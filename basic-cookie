# Basic cookie recipe

## Ingredients
* 227 grams unsalted butter
* 200 grams brown sugar (dark or light)
* 150 grams white sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 360 grams all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions (that are friendly even to people who don't bake)
* Preheat oven to 350Â°F. 
* Cream butter and sugars--that means use your beaters to mix them really well. It takes longer than you think. When it has changed color and is fluffy, you're in business. A stand mixer really helps keep your arm from getting worn out.
* Add in eggs and vanilla and mix for another minute until it's all smooth.
* Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt if you're feeling fancy, but honestly, if you add them to the bowl of other stuff and make sure the baking soda and salt don't clump together, it will almost certainly be fine.
* Mix it all together on low just until it all comes together in a ball. If you're going to add things in chocolate chips or other things, it's easiest to do it just after you start this mixing step, but you can also do it at the end.
* If you have a cookie scoop, use that to drop the cookie balls on parchment-lined cookie sheets. If not, make some 1-2" balls of cookie dough depending on how big you like your cookies. If you don't have parchment paper, spray the cookie sheets with baking spray. If you don't have baking spray, rub a stick of butter on them. If you don't have any butter left, you're probably going to have cookies stuck to the cookie sheet, but hey, you'll still have cookies.
* Bake for 8-9 minutes until edges are starting to brown. It's ok if they look a little underbaked in the middle when you take them out.
* Take them out of the oven and let the cookies cool on the cookie sheet for 3-4 minutes. Move them to wire racks to finish cooling. Or just eat them all.

## IDEAS
* Things you can mix in: chocolate chips (measure with your heart), broken up candy bars, raisins, sprinkles, other kinds of candy.
* For chocolate cookies, add a tablespoon of cocoa powder when you whisk together the dry ingredients.
* For oatmeal cookies, you can add anywhere from a couple of tablespoons of rolled oats to 2 cups, depending on how oaty you like them. If you add a lot, a tablespoon of molasses will help it all come together (and either way help the flavor). Two teaspoons of cinnamon are also a great addition.
* You can add a tablespoon or two of peanut butter, Nutella, or other spreads like that.
